    "# Warm-up challenges for week 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how Python and Jupyter Notebooks work and that you have read about Digital Analytics and Computational Social Science, it's time for you to combine apply this knowledge. This week has three preparatory challenges. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each challenge has two components:\n",
    "1. **Programming and interpretation**\n",
    "3. **Reflection**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some important notes for the challenges:**\n",
    "1. These challenges are a warming up, and help you get ready for class. Make sure to give them a try on all of them. \n",
    "2. If you get an error message, try to troubleshoot it (using Google often helps). If all else fails, go to the next challenge (but make sure to give it a try).\n",
    "3. These challenges are ungraded, yet they help you prepare for the graded challenges in the portfolio. If you want to be efficient, have a look at what you need to do for the upcoming graded challenges and see how to combine the work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Facing issues? \n",
    "\n",
    "We are constantly monitoring the issues on the GitHub to help you out. Don't hesitate to log an issue there, explaining well what the problem is, showing the code you are using, and the error message you may be receiving. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** We are only monitoring the repository in weekdays, from 9.30 to 17.00. Issues logged after this time will most likely be answered the next day. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Markdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make sure to combine code *and* markdown to answer all questions. Mention specifically the question (and question number) and the answer in markdown, relating to the code and the output of the code. For the graded challenges, failing to do so will impact the grade, as we will not be able to see whether you answered the question.\n",
    "2. For every line of code, please include a cell in MarkDown explaining what the code is expected to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out how to add (1) an image and (2) a link in a cell in MarkDown. You may need to search this online. Check how to do it, and include an image and a link in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now working with Jupyter Notebooks and Python code - and submitting your notebook as html via Canvas. Review the article *van Atteveldt et al. (2019)* and explain how these activities relate to open science principles, and connect them to the Computational Science workflow. Motivate your response. "
