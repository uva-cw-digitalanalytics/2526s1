    "### Exercise 1: Explanation of how code works\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not understand how a piece of code works, you can ask AI to explain it. This can be done in a simple way, e.g. ‚ÄúExplain what this piece of code does: [your code]\". To get explanations on a certain expertise level, you can include the ‚Äòpersona prompt pattern‚Äô (White et al., 2023). For instance, \"I want you to take on the persona of a university Python instructor talking to a student who has never taken a programming class before. Explain what this function does: [user‚Äôs code].‚Äù Another option is to specify/prime the type of desired code description: high-level, problem statement-like, or step-by-step.\n",

However, these developments have reignited concerns over privacy, data security, and ethical AI usage. Major tech companies have introduced AI tools that can process vast amounts of personal data, leading to fears of potential misuse. For example, AI-powered surveillance and deepfake technology have raised alarms among privacy advocates. Additionally, the collection and use of biometric data by AI models have sparked debates about consent and data protection.\"\n",
